    Maching Learning Algorithms From Scratch
</h1>

This repository contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms I have done from scratch.

* [**Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**](LDA)
    - Reduce the dimensionality of features space from 30-D to 1-D using Linear Discriminant Analysis algorithm with the goal of keeping the class information intact.
    - Dataset used: [Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)

* [**Deicsion Tree**](Decision-Tree)
    - Predict the class of iris plant using avilable features, a multi-class classification task.
    - Dataset used: [Iris](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris)

* [**K-Means Clustering**](K-Means-Clustering)
    - Segment customers to aid the marketing team and plan streategy accordingly.
    - Dataset used: [Mall Customer Segmentation Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python/data)

* [**K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)**](K-Nearest-Neighbours)
    - Predict whether a patient has diabetes based on diagnostic measurements.
    - Dataset used: [Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set)

* [**Linear Regression**](Linear-Regression)
    - Predict the quality of wine with the assistance of their physiochemical properties.
    - Dataset used: [Red Wine Quality](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality)

* [**Logistic Regression**](Logistic-Regression)
    - Predict whether the cancer type is `Malignant` or `Benign` using Logistic Regression algorithm, and achieved 98% accuracy and 0.97 F1-score and on test set.
    - Dataset used: [Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)

* [**Moving Averages**](Moving-Averages)
    - Apply Simple Moving Average, Commulative Moving Average, Weighted Moving Average, and Exponential Moving Average techniques on Air Quality Index
    - Dataset used: [Air Quality Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Air+Quality)

* [**Naive Bayes**](Navive_Bayes)
    - Classify the cancer type `Malignant` or `Benign` using Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm, and achieved 90% accuracy on test set.
    - Dataset used: [Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)

* [**Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**](PCA)
    - Reduce the dimenionsality of face images by approximately 250x using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and regenerate them using basis vectors.
    - Dataset used: [The Database of Faces (AT&T)](https://git-disl.github.io/GTDLBench/datasets/att_face_dataset)

* [**Perceptron**](Perceptron)
    - Demonstrate perceptron failure on non-seprable data.
    - Additionally, predict whether a patient has diabetes based on diagnostic measurements.
        - Dataset: [Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set)

* [**Simple Neural Network**](Simple-Neural-Network)
    - Designed a simple neural network (with forward and backward path) consists of an input layer, an output layer and a hidden layer.
    - Mimicking the behaviour of XOR gate.

* [**Support Vector Machine**](SVM)
    - Performed Binary classification to predict cancer types `Benign` or `Malignant` achieving up to 97% accuracy and 0.95 F1-Score on the test set.
